# hono-tailwind ðŸ”¥ (WIP)

This project is a [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) middleware for [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono).

### Usage (Subject to change)

1. Install the package

```bash
bun add hono-tailwind
```

2. Add the middleware to your Hono app

It requires no config, so you can just throw it in to hack around and it will work.
Please note that this isn't really recommended for production - this will just toss the CSS into a `<style />` tag.
```ts
import { hono } from "hono";
import { tailwind } from "hono-tailwind";
import { serveStatic } from "hono/bun";

const app = hono();

app.use(tailwind());
app.get("/", (c) => c.html(html`<h1 class="text-red-500 font-bold">Hello World</h1>`));
```

If you would like, you can pass in your `app` instance to the middleware, and it will serve the CSS file for you. (Based on the pasth you configure)
```ts
import { hono } from "hono";
import { tailwind } from "hono-tailwind";

const app = hono();

// refers to your app's root directory
app.use(tailwind({ outputPath: "./dist/output.css" }), app);
```

Here's what the middleware will look like fully configured:
```ts
import { hono } from "hono";
import { tailwind } from "hono-tailwind";

const app = hono();

app.use(tailwind({
  input: "./src/static/main.css",
  configPath: "./tailwind.config.js",
  outputPath: "./dist/output.css",
}, app));

### Goals

- [x] Be able to use TailwindCSS in Hono just by adding this as a middleware.
- [x] In development, use in-memory CSS and append it into the Head of your HTML.
- [x] Build CSS into a single file that then gets imported automagically in production environments.
- [x] All in all let the user be completely hands-off with the whole TailwindCSS build process.
- [x] Potentially be able to get started with 0 config (just add the middleware and boom tailwind is in).
- [ ] Be able to take in a path to an HTML file and use that as the users' base HTML.
- [ ] Take in a path to your TailwindCSS entrypoint css file.
- [ ] Support more than just Bun. The serve static middleware is specific to Bun currently.
- [ ] Support more renderers than just the default one. For example, if you are using React renderer (third-party middleware), I don't think this will work - requires testing.
- [ ] Support a PostCSS config file.

### Motivation

I really love working with Hono, but installing TailwindCSS is a pain. I also do not want to run a separate process alongside my server, as that is tedious. In my future projects with Hono, I want to be able to add this middleware and just get started designing with TailwindCSS.
